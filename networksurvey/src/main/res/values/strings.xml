        <![CDATA[
        The upload feature allows you to share collected cellular and Wi-Fi survey data with third-party databases.<br/><br/>
        <b>How This Feature Works:</b><br/>
        &#8226; When started, survey records collected by the app are written to an internal database. You can then decide whether to upload the stored records to the selected destinations.<br/>
        &#8226; When stopped, no survey data is written to the internal database, and no survey data is uploaded to a third-party database.<br/><br/>

        <b>Where Your Data Goes:</b><br/>
        Your survey data will be uploaded to one or both of the following services, depending on your selections:<br/>
        &#8226; <a href="https://www.opencellid.org/"><b>OpenCelliD</b></a> - A global open-source cell tower database.<br/>
        &#8226; <a href="https://api.beacondb.net/"><b>BeaconDB</b></a> - A crowdsourced geolocation database.<br/><br/>

        <b>What Data Is Uploaded:</b><br/>
        &#8226; <b>Device Location</b> (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Accuracy, Speed)<br/>
        &#8226; <b>Cellular Information</b> (MCC, MNC, TAC/LAC, Cell ID, Signal Strength, Timing Advance, PCI, ARFCN, etc.)<br/>
        &#8226; <b>Wi-Fi Information</b> (SSID, BSSID, Frequency, Channel, Signal Strength, Encryption Type)<br/>
        &#8226; <b>Timestamp</b> of Collection<br/><br/>

        <b>When new records are written to the database</b><br/>
        Cellular and Wi-Fi Survey data is written to the database only if it contains all the required information, AND if the location of the device has changed by at least 35 meters since the last record was written. This is to prevent an excessive amount of survey data from being uploaded to the servers for the same location.<br/><br/>

        Data is anonymized and used to improve cellular and Wi-Fi coverage mapping, as well as enhance the BeaconDB geolocation service.<br/><br/>

    <string name="cdr_help_title">CDR Information</string>
    <string name="cdr_help">What is a CDR? A CDR is a Call Detail Record that has an event for specific
        interaction a phone has with the cellular network. For example, a phone call, sms messages, and certain tower
        changes. The Network Survey app has a CDR File Logging feature that allows for logging CDR events to a CSV file.
        There are several possible use cases for recording a CDR; for example, one might be to have a record of
        what your phone is doing, and what towers it is communicating with.
        \n\nWorthy of note, the regular version of Network Survey does not log SMS events in the CDR, nor does it
        support logging the "other" phone number associated with a phone call. Logging SMS events requires the
        full SMS permission, and Google Play won\'t approve publishing Network Survey to the Play Store
        if it requests the SMS permission. If you are interested in a CDR logger that supports SMS events
        and logging the "other" phone number for call events, check out the information in the Network Survey User Manual: https://networksurvey.app/manual#cdr</string>


    <string name="file_help_title">File Logging &amp; MQTT Streaming: Simplified</string>
    <string name="file_help">Need help understanding the File Logging and MQTT sections? Here\'s a quick guide:\n\n
<b>File Logging Control:</b>\n
This section is all about saving data locally to your phone. When you toggle one of the options to <b>\'On\'</b>,
the app will start logging that data type to a file in GeoPackage and/or CSV format (depending on the configured
setting), which you can find on your device. Remember:\n
\n
- Toggle <b>Cellular</b>, <b>Wi-Fi</b>, <b>Bluetooth</b>, <b>GNSS</b>, and/or <b>CDR</b> under File Logging Control to save this data locally.\n
- Logging is completely optional and does not affect MQTT Streaming.\n
\n
<b>MQTT Connection:</b>\n
MQTT streaming lets you send your data in real-time to a remote server. No local storage is needed for this:\n
\n
- First, configure the broker connection settings.\n
- Ensure the switch is on to activate streaming.\n
- MQTT Streaming works independently of File Logging. You don\'t need to turn on File Logging to stream data.\n
\n
Use File Logging for local storage and MQTT Streaming for remote transmission. They both capture the same data,
but work independently, so you have full control over how you handle your data.</string>
